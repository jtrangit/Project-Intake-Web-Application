# Temple University - Project Intake Web Application

Overview:  
The goal of this web application is to expedite the 
project proposal process for students studying information science and technology. 
Since Temple does not currently have a platform specifically for project 
submissions, an effective process that enables people and organizations to submit project ideas for the Temple IS&T Capstone Course, 
have them reviewed, and have them approved. By streamlining the 
submission, review, and approval procedures, the online application will  improve 
capstone project visibility and communication.
