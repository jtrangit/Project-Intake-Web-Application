  <h1>📚 Capstone Project Proposal Manager</h1>
  <p>Streamlining academic project proposals for students and faculty</p>
</header>

<main>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The goal of this web application is to expedite the 
    project proposal process for students studying information science and technology. 
    Since Temple does not currently have a platform specifically for project 
    submissions, an effective process that enables people and organizations to submit project ideas for the Temple IS&T Capstone Course, 
    have them reviewed, and have them approved. By streamlining the 
    submission, review, and approval procedures, the online application will  improve 
    capstone project visibility and communication.

  <p>
    This Repository is a visible copy of the actual repo used during development
    that I wish to have shown on my github, as the actual repo is private and managed
    by the Temple University IS&T faculty.
    
    This project is functional, published and hosted on the Temple University servers.
    But since I have graduated from Temple I no longer have the authentication and access
    to the project. I only wish to have this repo serving as proof that was a collaborator
    on this project.
    
    Further documentation about this project can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T5RkYzr3XtUQmaPMZ0mVm3Kk7uVlGpLvS8qpSY2DpX4/edit?tab=t.0
    <br/>
    
    And the project is hosted here: https://np-stem.temple.edu/cis4396-f04/ (though you need to be connected to Temple's servers to be able to access it)
