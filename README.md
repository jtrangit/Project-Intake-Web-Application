# Temple University - Project Intake Web Application

Collaborators: Neel Patel, Nathan Marzina, Johnny Tran, Abhijay Shekhawat, Carlos Chavez, Johnson Chieu

Overview:  
The goal of this web application is to expedite the 
project proposal process for students studying information science and technology. 
Since Temple does not currently have a platform specifically for project 
submissions, an effective process that enables people and organizations to submit project ideas for the Temple IS&T Capstone Course, 
have them reviewed, and have them approved. By streamlining the 
submission, review, and approval procedures, the online application will  improve 
capstone project visibility and communication.  

This Repository is a visible copy of the actual repo used during development
that I wish to have shown on my github, as the actual repo is private and managed
by the Temple University IS&T faculty.

This project is functional, published and hosted on the Temple University servers.
But since I have graduated from Temple I no longer have the authentication and access
to the project. I only wish to have this repo serving as proof that was a collaborator
on this project.

Further documentation about this project can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T5RkYzr3XtUQmaPMZ0mVm3Kk7uVlGpLvS8qpSY2DpX4/edit?tab=t.0
<br/>

And the project is hosted here: https://np-stem.temple.edu/cis4396-f04/ (though you need to be connected to Temple's servers to be able to access it)
